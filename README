HTMLGREP

  htmlgrep is a suite of command-line tools for searching HTML
  documents, that allows selecting elements by various types of
  selectors.

   It currently only provides a single utility program:

    - css(1)

  The tools are built with the HTML tree manipulation library Kuchiki
  (朽木), which uses the same HTML parser as the Servo browser
  engine.

BUILDING

  To build everything, ensure you have the stable Rust toolchain
  installed, as well as asciidoc, which is used for compiling the
  man pages:

  	make

  Tests can be run this way:

  	make test

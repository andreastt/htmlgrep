  	fn main() {
  		let input = r#"
  			<!doctype html>
  			<meta charset=utf>
  			<title>My first blog post</title>
  			<meta name=keywords content=blog,first,hello>
  			<meta name=description content="First entry to blog.">
  		"#;

  		let matches = htmlgrep::select("meta[name=keywords]", input.as_bytes()).unwrap();

  		for node in matches {
  			println!("{}", node.source);
  		}
  	}

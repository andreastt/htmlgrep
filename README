htmlgrep is a suite of command-line tools for searching HTML
documents, that allows selecting elements by various types of
selectors.

It currently only provides a single utility program:

  - css(1)

The tools are built with the HTML tree manipulation library Kuchiki
(朽木), which uses the same HTML parser as the Servo browser engine.

Please see the website for usage instructions:

To build everything, ensure you have the stable Rust toolchain
installed:

	make

Tests can be run this way:

	make test
